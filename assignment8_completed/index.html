	<h1>Meta Quest 3 Launches ‘Later Next Year</h1>

	<p>The “next generation consumer Quest” will launch “later next year”, Meta’s CFO told investors.</p>

	<p>During Meta’s Q3 2022 earnings call, David Wehner mentioned the headset while warning investors of increasing costs next year:
	</p>

	<blockquote>“Conversely, our growth in cost of revenue is expected to accelerate, driven by infrastructure-related expenses and, to a lesser extent, Reality Labs hardware costs driven by the launch of our next generation of our consumer Quest headset later next year.”</blockquote>

	<p>Reality Labs is the division of Meta behind Quest headsets, smart glasses, Meta Avatars, Horizon, and research & development towards future devices such as the neural wristband project and AR glasses.</p>

	<p>Earlier this month Mark Zuckerberg told Stratechery “there will be a Quest 3 and that’s in the price range of $300, $400, or $500, that zone”, but said it isn’t launching this year. He first confirmed Quest 3 was in development in an interview last year. Quest 2 is the current consumer Quest so given Zuckerberg’s comments, Wehner is almost certainly referring to Quest 3.</p>	

	<p>Wehner’s reference to cost growth suggests this $300-$500 price will be achieved through subsidization, just as Quest 2’s $300 launch price was.</p>	

	<p>So what do we know about Quest 3 so far, and what has been apparently leaked?</p>

	<p>During Connect 2022, “Consulting CTO” John Carmack said Meta’s future headsets, presumably including Quest 3, will support 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
