      A top commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard has been killed in an
      airstrike on the country's consulate building in Damascus, Syria,
      according to Iranian officials and state-affiliated media, which blamed
      Israel for the attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Iranian Quds</b> Force commander Mohammed Reza Zahedi was among those
      killed in the incident on Monday, according to Iran's foreign ministry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking to reporters in Damascus, Iranian ambassador Hossein Akbari
      alleged that the building “was targeted with six missiles from Israeli
      F-35 warplanes.”

    <p>
      Akbari added that Iranian diplomatic staff and military advisers were
      killed in the attack, and their names will be announced later. In a
      separate interview later on Monday, he said two Syrian policemen were
      among the people injured.

    <p>CNN cannot independently verify the claims or casualty figures.</p>

    <p>
      Syrian state media Syrian Arab News Agency also reported that “an Israeli
      act of aggression targeted on Monday afternoon a building in Mezzeh
      neighborhood in Damascus,” causing “massive destruction.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Asked for comment on the incident by CNN, the Israel Defense Forces said
      it does not comment on foreign reports. Footage of the aftermath of the
      blast, published by Iranian state media Press TV, showed damage to the
      building, fire and smoke at the scene.
