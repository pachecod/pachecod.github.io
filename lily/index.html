      <h2>The Air We Breathe: An Examination of New York City's Continuing Air Pollution Crisis</h2>
      <p>
        New York City is one of the largest cities in the world, not to mention one of the most impactful as well. It is filled with an energy that has been influenced by world-class entertainment, culture and economic importance. People travel from all over the world to live or just get a chance to visit the bustling city. Unfortunately, it is not entirely magical in the city that never sleeps. The city has always been constantly struggling with air pollution and the rise of it in recent years. Air pollution can be defined as the contamination of the air by agents of chemical, biological and physical matter that affect the atmosphere’s natural, needed and healthy characteristics.

      <p>
        Air pollution is particularly worse in New York City than other locations around the world for countless reasons. First off, the increase in human activity. Everyone wants to come visit the “concrete jungle where dreams are made of,” especially during summer holidays. This increase of vehicle traffic can lead to an increase in industrial activities which then translates to higher emissions of pollutants. Air pollution is the largest external risk to human health globally. 
        It contributes to premature deaths, with NYC facing significant challenges from industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and climate change impacts.

        <h3>The Role of Heat Waves and Climate Change in NYC's Air Quality Crisis</h3>
        <p>
          Heat waves are also a factor in causing poor air quality. José Bayona, former executive director at the NYC Mayor’s Office of Ethnic and Community Media, says the heat waves are caused by climate change which is one of the fastest growing issues in today’s society. Alongside pollutants emitting from cars, factories, construction projects and energy needs, New York City is basically being buried under a cloud of smog, especially in the summer months.

        <h3>Understanding Air Pollution: Key Pollutants and Their Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Some people may not think that air pollution is a big deal or they don’t understand what the words air pollution truly means. Essentially, there are six pollutants that are considered air pollutants by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency otherwise known as the EPA. Ground level ozone and particle pollution make up two of these air pollutants. They are accompanied by lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides as the other air pollutants on this list. Those are not the only air pollutants that contribute to air pollution however, other pollutants like carbon disulfide, kerosene and asbestos are also large factors.

    <h2>Air Quality and Public Health</h2>
    <p>
      <div>
        <p>
          It is common knowledge that climate change is harmful to our future and air pollution goes right along with it. Air pollution is seen as the biggest external risk to human health around the world. According to the State of Global Air, 8.1 million premature deaths can be blamed on issues linked to air pollution. That is more deaths caused by pollutants than tobacco globally. The World Health Organization has set an air guideline limit used to help advise people on healthy air quality. Unfortunately, 99% of people are breathing in air that is exceeding the World Health Organizations said guideline limits. Currently, air pollution is shortening the average life expectancy by 2.2 years.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Bayona is passionate about this issue as he concluded that it is “not just an issue for every person everywhere, it is also a socioeconomic issue, especially in New York City.”
        </p>
      
        <p>
          People in low-income neighborhoods, where air pollution is usually heaviest, are more affected by health issues brought on by air pollution, as are young children and the elderly. Bayona agrees that air pollution is made worse by urban living but unfortunately residents in these urban areas are also affected by their income. Worse air quality in lower-income neighborhoods can be pointed at location and proximity to factories emitting air pollutants, distance from major highways like Interstate 95 and the West Side Highway. Even distance from ports home to mega cruise ship lines or diesel truck operations can determine the quality of air.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Since the summer of 2023 when air quality conditions were at a record-breaking all-time low in NYC as a result of the smoke from the wildfire in Quebec, Canada, Bayona has been concerned about his city’s future. He explained the in-depth detection process that the city has formed to test the air quality at any time. NYC has street-level monitors which are able to measure ground-level exposure. Alongside these monitors are eleven rooftop monitors provided and looked after by the NY State Department of Environmental Conservation which reports back to the Federal Clean Air Act. Bayona continues that the air quality measurements are taken hourly in measurements of PM2.5 in micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m³). This allows for an active and accurate Air Quality Index, a scale from zero to 500.

          New York State’s Air Pollution Control Program has been surviving for over 50 years, working everyday to try and improve the air quality throughout NYC. Their work includes mandatory permits to control emission of pollutants and intense monitoring of pollutant labels. The NYS APCP has also instituted the Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program which closely examines car emissions. The Department of Environmental Conservation also requires State Implementation Plans to be submitted where air pollution is too high.

          Although it may not seem like it, New York City’s air quality has improved over the years and since the summer of 2023. NYC is actively working on their air pollution problems but also encouraging their residents to take the precautions needed. Staying indoors when the air quality is poor, using an air purifier, reducing indoor air pollutants and energy use and wearing a mask when needed are all beneficial ideas to protect yourself and loved ones from air pollution. Big organizations are not the only ones who can try and improve the air quality. Bayona says his favorite way to limit air pollutant emissions is to ride his bike to work, it’s great for the environment and has an added bonus of healthy exercising.
