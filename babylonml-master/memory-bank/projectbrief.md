# Project Brief: BabylonML

## Core Goal

To create a declarative, markup-based framework (similar to A-Frame or HTML) for building 3D scenes using Babylon.js. This framework, tentatively named BabylonML, aims to simplify the process of creating and managing Babylon.js scenes by abstracting away boilerplate code and providing a component-based architecture.

## Key Requirements

-   **Declarative Syntax:** Define scenes, entities, and components using an HTML-like markup language.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** Allow developers to attach reusable behaviors and properties (components) to entities.
-   **Extensibility:** Enable the creation and registration of custom components and primitives.
-   **Babylon.js Integration:** Leverage the power and features of the Babylon.js engine for rendering and interaction.
-   **Ease of Use:** Provide a simpler entry point for web developers looking to build 3D experiences.

## Target Audience

-   Web developers familiar with HTML/CSS/JS.
-   Developers looking for a faster way to prototype and build Babylon.js scenes.
-   Educators and students learning 3D web development.
