    <h1>The Story of Dan Pacheco</h1>

    <h2>
      Take a tour through all the places I've lived.
    </h2>

    <p>
      I was born in a town called Niceville in Florida, a place I don't remember because my parents moved almost immediately after I was born. My father was in the Air Force at the time and stationed at Eglin Air Force Base. For this reason, I really can't be considered a Floridian.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I turned 50 last week, and it occured to me that each decade of my life was dominated by a different places. Those are:
      
        <ul>
       <li><b>Era 1:</b> 1971-early 1980s: Colorado (the Air Force Academy and Fort Collins)</li> 
        <ul>
          
          <li><i><b>Sub era:</b> 1985-1986: The Hague, Holland</i></li>
          </ul>
        <li><b>Era 2:</b> 1986-1994: Colorado (Colorado Springs and Boulder)</li>
        <li><b>Era 3:</b> 1995-2004: The Washington, D.C. area.</li>
          <li><b>Era 4:</b> 2004-2012: Broomfield, Colorado</li>
          <li><b>2Era 5:</b> 012-today: Syrause, NY</li>
    </ul>
   
    </p>
  </p>

<p>
  I thoroughy enjoyed each era, but do sometimes feel like I have lived like an electron circling an atom. On three separate occasions, I moved away from Colorado, but always returned. What will happen in my next era? Who knows? (But don't worry, I don't plan on leaving Syracuse any time soon.)

  Here's a map of the Story of Me.
