    <h1>Uranus, the ice giant, may have been misunderstood for nearly 40 years</h1>

    <h2>A rare solar wind event was taking place when NASA’s Voyager 2 zipped by in 1986, a study suggests, which affected what we believed about the enigmatic planet.</h2>

    <p>Uranus, the third-largest planet in our solar system, has always been something of an enigma.</p>

    <p>Now, it seems that our understanding of the planet — garnered mostly from a flyby by a NASA spacecraft nearly 4o years ago — may be flawed.</p>
    
    <p>A study published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy suggests that when Voyager 2 zipped by in 1986, Uranus was in the midst of a rare solar wind event that colored scientists' conclusions about the ice giant.</p>
    
    <p>“Our understanding of the Uranus system may be more limited than previously thought,” the authors wrote.</p>
    
    <p>The seventh planet from the sun has been visited only once. The rest of what we know comes from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and several other telescopes.</p>

    <p>Voyager 2 traveled more than 1.8 billion miles in nine years to reach Uranus. It gathered most of its data on the mysterious planet, including its rings and moons, in just six hours.</p>

    <p>The results of that 1986 visit indicated that Uranus's magnetosphere — the protective magnetic field that surrounds planets, including Earth — was unique.</p>

    <p>It appeared to be strongly asymmetrical, with surprisingly intense radiation belts given that it seemed to be lacking plasma, energetic ionized particles that are common to other planets' magnetospheres.</p>
