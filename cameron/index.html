        When people from other countries conjure up images of the United States, there are a few staple stereotypes that come to mind first—cowboys, football, firearms, and of course, obesity.

 Obesity has become a very well-documented public health issue in American society and has been for quite some time. Obesity as a condition carries a slew of negative health effects, from increased risk of diabetes, stroke, organ failure, and several cardiovascular diseases, all of which can have disastrous impacts on a person’s quality of life.


The obesity rate for the United States is estimated to be around 42.7% according to a survey conducted by the World Population Review. This would make the United States the 18th most obese country in the world. 


Data concerning obesity rates that was collected at the state level seems to support this statement. The government of Lake County Illinois released data that displayed each state’s obesity rate, using survey data from the 2015 rendition of the Center for Disease Control’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, displaying damning results.

      Even the state with the lowest rate of obesity, Colorado, is still over 20%, with the highest, Louisiana, carrying an obesity rate of 36.2%. This means that no matter where you go in America, between one in four, and one in three people you meet will classify as obese statistically. 

      Where there is cause however, there is also effect. There are many different factors that effect the skyrocketing obesity rates that America is facing, one of the main contributions being socioeconomic differences between the lower, middle, and upper classes within American society.
      
      The quality of life in America, as a capitalist society, is intrinsically tied to individual economic success. This applies to all sectors of life, from transportation, entertainment, housing, and of course, to food. The United States Department of Health and Human Services released data on obesity risk factors using data from the 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, where a much smaller sample size was surveyed, but coming with similar conclusions across the board.

      The graph on the left compares the rates of obesity in various states by the level of income. The states included such as Colorado, Massachusetts, and New York rank among some of the least obese, and wealthiest states nationwide, while the other states such as Mississippi, Louisiana, and West Virginia rank among the most obese, and least wealthy. 

Despite the vast difference in statewide obesity rates, and socioeconomic statuses of these states, the one factor that remained the same between them all, was a stark contrast in obesity rates between those who make less than their respective state’s median income, versus those who make more. 

In this case, those who are lower on the socioeconomic totem pole tend to be more obese on average than their wealthier counterparts. Syracuse University Human Geography Professor Carlo Sica says that this is to be expected.

Sica explained that people who have less money at their disposal to spend tend to live in lower-quality areas. These areas are generally lacking in good quality infrastructure. This means that not only are there less amounts of supermarkets that sell high quality, nutritious food items, but also unreliable public transportation that can take them there. Since people with less money are less likely to own a personal vehicle, they are forced to be reliant on various modes of public transportation such as subways and busses. Due to this, the structural limitations that hinder the development of public transportation prevent lower-income citizens from even being able to obtain healthier goods. So, these people tend to gravitate towards cheaper, more easily accessible alternatives to obtaining food, which generally includes higher consumption of lower quality processed foods and various fast food chains, according to Sica.

Viewing the data through Sica’s lens of socioeconomic examination shows that correlation remains present even at the state level. Some of the states that have the highest obesity rates in the nation, are Mississippi, Louisiana, and West Virginia. These states are also known for being among the poorest in the nation, with some of the highest poverty rates, with 18.8, 18.6, and 17.9 percent of these states’ respective populations living below the poverty line.

For the United States, its less of an issue with the overall supply of healthy food, than it is a general accessibility issue. High rates of obesity are not simply due to a result of personal choices, but rather that people simply can’t afford to spend the money necessary to obtain these goods. 

With inflation rising, and an increasingly strained economy causing the price of goods, and the cost of living to rise, this problem may only become more inflated in the future. Especially with the new Trump administration standing poised to take the reigns of the country, the tariffs he plans to implement and his proposed tax breaks for mega-corporations may only serve to make matters worse.
