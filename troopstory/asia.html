<p>The United States has sent a significant number of troops to South Korea since the 1990s, while it has sent nearly none to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (or North Korea). Since the Korean War in the 1950s, there has been a continued disagreement between North and South Korea. In this war, South Korea was supported by the United States. Thus, even after the war, the United States continued to support South Korea.</p>

  It is not surprising that the U.S. has sent zero troops to North Korea for the majority of years from 1991 to 2020. However, what is surprising, is that the U.S. sent 24 troops in 2003. The reason for this drastic change in deployment has to do with North Korea pulling out of the Nonproliferation Treaty in January of 2003.

<p>The U.S. military divide between these two nations is an extremely dangerous place and therefore needs the help of the powerful U.S. military. Observing the chart and provided information, the United States deployed a declined amount of troops into Japan, beginning in 2016.</p>

<p>According to NPR, this sharp decrease came following the 2016 election of
President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump shared his frustrations with several
U.S. allies, including Japan, over not paying their share for deployment. In
2016, there was also a spike in tensions/crimes committed by U.S. soldiers
towards Okinawan civilians, noted in Time magazine, which could be observed as a
cause of increased tensions.
